# Counting bottles in a crate
We are given crate pictures that contain bottles. Some of them are easy to count bottles but some of them are ambiguous. We tried several approaches including morphological operations and the best result was from Hough Transform. Before applying Hough Transform, we also preprocessed our images to get the best results. The detailed explanation is in pdf.

There are 2 approaches in this repository. Codes are written in Matlab.
